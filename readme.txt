Source code of the algorithm.

Run the code on the Linux system.

Please note that you need to create a folder named image2 in the code directory for outputting PP and PS imaging.

The code has designed a simple model for verification, and the model is already included in the code. If you want to output the model, you need to create a new file named "model" in the directory where the code is located and uncomment the part of the code that outputs the model.

The code execution results show that after removing the implicit assumptions, the equation has eliminated the interference of P-waves on S-waves.
